# SFMC Field Notes
This is a collection of data and automation practices in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud platform, written by Arthur Mendez <yo@rthur.dev>. The reach here is to educate SFMC developers on effiecient methods within the platform, with the hope of improving global SMFC stability. I have worked on a ~100 SFMC accounts and found that these notes here are the most effective at performance and implementation.
